# Flipkart-GRID-5.0
GRiD is Flipkartâ€™s Flagship Engineering Campus Challenge which provides you with the opportunity to apply your technical knowledge and skills, to compete and complete key challenges.
We were expected to design a model on the themes offered to us in this **Flipkart GRiD 5.0 - Software Development Track**, and I chose to build a model on personalised product recommendations using machine learning.

Personalized product recommendation is a technique that uses machine learning algorithms to suggest products to users based on their individual preferences and past behavior. This can be a powerful tool for increasing sales and improving customer satisfaction.

## How personalized product recommendation works

Personalized product recommendation systems typically work by collecting data about users, such as their browsing history, purchase history, and demographic information. This data is then used to train machine learning models that can identify patterns in user behavior. These models can then be used to predict which products a user is likely to be interested in.

## Process at a brief
In this model, I utilised a faker module to produce the requisite fake dataset and use it to develop the appropriate model.<br>
This model is intended to improve user experience by implementing a personalised product ranking system. The ranking algorithm should take into account user preferences, previous interactions, product popularity, and user similarities. Based on a user's unique features and interests, it should be able to anticipate the most appropriate products for them.
